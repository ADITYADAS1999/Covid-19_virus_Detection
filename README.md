Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel disease caused by a newly identified virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel disease which begun in Wuhan, China in Dec 2019 was declareda pandemic by World Health Organization on 11 March 2020. There are multiple tests for COVID and each test takes its own time to come up with the results. There are three main types of COVID-19 tests. Molecular tests (also known as PCR tests) detect the genetic material of the coronavirus. The Panbio™ COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test is an antigen test. Antigen tests detect coronavirus proteins. In this situation the RT-PCR test results take as early as 24 hours after sample collection, but sometimes it can take a few days, where as a ML algorithm detect within few minutes.

## 👨‍💻 What it does  ⚗🧪🧬

This is a Covid-19 virus detection application. Initially this application uses a machine learning model. The uses upload the Chest X-Ray or Brain scan Images to the user interface and the API take the input and proceed those input to ML model. The machine learning model process and analysis those inputs and generate output like a patient is a covid-19 +ve or covid-19 -ve. And finally the API take those inputs to the user interface. In this way this application basically works.

## 🔩 How we built it 🧫

This application is build on python and I use python web framework for deploy my application locally. And also I build a nice user interface using JavaScript, html, CSS.
